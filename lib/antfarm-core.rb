  # Some explanation to having @netmask and such:
  #   If you create a new IPAddr object and you include
  #   the network information for the IP address, IPAddr
  #   doesn't keep track of the actual address, and
  #   instead just keeps track of the network.  For
  #   example, if you were to create a new IPAddr object
  #   using the following code:
  #
  #   IPAddr.new("192.168.101.5/24")
  #
  #   the resulting object would be of the form:
  #
  #   <IPAddr: IPv4:192.168.101.0/255.255.255.0>
  #
  #   and there would be no way to retrieve the original
  #   address (192.168.101.5).  By creating this class,
  #   Michael has made it possible to keep track of both
  #   the address and the network information.  This is
  #   useful in the case of creating a new IPInterface
  #   object.
  #
  # TODO: If a netmask is given, should we somehow check
  #       to see if an address is being given with network
  #       information or if a network is being specified,
  #       and if it is a network, should we validate that
  #       the network address is valid with the given
  #       netmask?  This may be done automatically... I
  #       need to look more into how IPAddr works.
