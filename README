== Welcome to ANTFARM

ANTFARM is a passive network mapping application that utilizes
output from existing network examination tools to populate its
OSI-modeled database.  This data can then be used to form a
'picture' of the network being analyzed.

== Getting Started

As of now, the ANTFARM application is a command-line tool written
to be used in a Linux environment (hopefully someone will want to
make a Windows verson... :).  The following can be done to get up
and running with ANTFARM.

=== Installation

ANTFARM is packaged as a Ruby Gem, so the easiest way to install
it is to run 'gem install ANTFARM' from the command line.

=== Initialization

ANTFARM can be ran purely from within the Gem environment, but users
will not have the ability to (easily) save copies of the database and
use custom input/output scripts.  However, if the user executes

'antfarm db --initialize'

from the command-line, a .antfarm directory will be created in the user's
home directory.  Within this directory there will exist a db, log, and
scripts directory.  The databases and log files created by ANTFARM will
reside here, and any custom scripts written by the user can be placed here
to be made available to the application.

== Description of Contents

Add stuff here...

== Description of Defaults

Currently, the ANTFARM application is hard-coded to use an sqlite3 database.  
The name given for the ANTFARM environment (which defaults to 'antfarm') is 
the name used for the database file and the log file.
