== Welcome to ANTFARM

ANTFARM is a passive network mapping application that utilizes
output from existing network examination tools to populate its
OSI-modeled database.  This data can then be used to form a
'picture' of the network being analyzed.

== Getting Started

As of now, the ANTFARM application is a command-line tool written
to be used in a Linux environment (hopefully someone will want to
make a Windows verson... :).  The following can be done to get up
and running with ANTFARM.

=== Installation

ANTFARM is packaged as a Ruby Gem, so the easiest way to install
it is to run 'gem install ANTFARM' from the command line.

=== Initialization

ANTFARM can be ran purely from within the Gem environment, but users
will not have the ability to (easily) save copies of the database and
use custom input/output scripts.  However, if the user executes

'antfarm db --initialize'

from the command-line, a <tt>.antfarm</tt> directory will be created in the 
user's home directory.  Within this directory there will exist a <tt>db</tt>, 
<tt>log</tt>, and <tt>scripts</tt> directory.  The databases and log files 
created by ANTFARM will reside here, and any custom scripts written by the 
user can be placed here to be made available to the application.

== Description of Contents

Add stuff here...

== Description of Defaults

Currently, the ANTFARM application is hard-coded to use an sqlite3 database.  
The name given for the ANTFARM environment (which defaults to 'antfarm') is 
the name used for the database file and the log file.

== Example Usage

Scripts are used to input data into the ANTFARM database.  Multiple scripts already
exist in the tool for parsing configuration files, traffic sniffs, etc.  To see
the scripts that currently exist, type

'antfarm help'

Below is a __very__ simple example of a script to read in network segments.  The 
script assumes it's parsing a file with one network defined per line.

  begin
    list = File.open(file)
  rescue Errno::ENOENT
    puts "The file '#{file}' does not exist"
    exit
  end

  list.each do |network|
    IpNetwork.create :address => network.strip
  end

The above code is acutally what's present in the <tt>load-network</tt> script.  To
run this script, you would type

'antfarm load-network <data_file>'

Most built-in scripts have help text associated with them, so typing

'antfarm <script_name> --help'

will display some useful information.

Feel free to read the source code for the built-in scripts, which are located in the
<tt>ANTFARM_ROOT/lib/scripts/</tt> directory.  These will most likely be good examples
for learning how to create custom scripts.  You may add custom scripts to
<tt>HOME_DIR/.antfarm/scripts/</tt> directory and they will be available in the
ANTFARM application.
